This is an ASCII graphics adaptation of the popular Rock Paper Scissors game in Python.

Game Play:
1. The computer asks for an input from the user in the form of r for Rock, p for Paper and s for Scissors. The user can select one move and enter the corresponding alphabet for that move.

2. The computer's move is selected randomly from a list of moves.

The ASCI art has been copied from https://gist.github.com/wynand1004/b5c521ea8392e9c6bfe101b025c39abe.
